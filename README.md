# Stock Anomaly Detector

I recently wrapped up an exciting project where I developed a real-time anomaly detection application for stock market data using Python. This system leverages Machine Learning—specifically the Isolation Forest algorithm—alongside yFinance to analyze live stock prices and detect unusual market behavior.

Key Features:
1️⃣ Live Data Retrieval – The app continuously fetches real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance.
2️⃣ ML-Based Anomaly Detection – It identifies significant deviations in price trends, flagging unusual spikes, sudden drops, or unexpected movements.
3️⃣ Visual Insights – The detected anomalies are plotted using Matplotlib for intuitive analysis and deeper market understanding.

This tool is particularly valuable for traders and algorithmic strategies, as it helps uncover potential trading opportunities by highlighting outliers in stock price movements. It can be useful for spotting market inefficiencies, price manipulation, or even early signals of significant trend shifts—making it a great asset for high-frequency trading (HFT) systems. 🚀
